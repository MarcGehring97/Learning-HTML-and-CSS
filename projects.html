          <p id="project1"><strong>[Started on 4th of November 2020 and finished on 9th of November 2020]</strong><br>I started this project since I was looking for a feasible project to improve my coding skills. Moreover, this pandemic has really impaired my social life and I was looking for a distraction (laughing face). Now, I’m aware that HTML and CSS are not full programming languages, but the activity still helped me in understanding the formal proceedings in writing code. I tried to take away as much as possible from this experience, and so I also used GitHub to organize my coding. For those of you who do not know, GitHub is an environment, in which you can write your code and also track changes over time. It’s also useful when you work on a project as a team, as you can discuss changes and revert to earlier versions of your code. Beyond getting familiar with GitHub, I also learned how to use the terminal to navigate among different folders and files and commit and push changes in git. I started preparing by watching the first and second lecture of <a href=”https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/”> this course</a> offered by Harvard University. While these lectures gave me a good theoretical basis for my project, I still needed some applied knowledge. In fact, I tried to start coding right after watching both lectures, but I quickly came to realize that I needed more exposure to HTML and CSS. Consequently, I took the codecademy course <a href=”https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website”> "How to make a Website with Namecheap"</a> and <a href=”https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-responsive-design”> "Learn Responsive Design"</a>. Moreover, the following courses might also proof useful to you, should you be interested in starting a similar project for yourself: <a href=”https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-bootstrap”>"Learn Bootstrap"</a>, <a href=”https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-navigation-design”>"Learn Navigation Design"</a>, and <a href=”https://www.codecademy.com/learn/build-interactive-websites”>"Build Interactive Websites"</a>. codecademy offers a one-week trial, so make sure to use that. The courses progress slowly at times, but the lessons are hands-on and definitely worth your time! Having taken those courses, I felt prepared proceed to the next step (I actually started to code while I worked on the courses). Before actually starting to code, though, I drafted my homepage in PowerPoint as an implementation blueprint. I took a lot of ideas, such as the rolling letters on my homepage, from other websites, but the space design is entirely my work. When I finally started to code my website, I tried to stick to the Bootstrap structure, a framework that helps you to structure your website, but I did not manage to realize all my ideas within this framework. Moreover, my website is responsive to a decent degree. I still decided to turn off some responsive elements, as I actually enjoy the full website look, even on mobile. Beyond that, the coding in HTML and CSS is rather straight-forward. My project became interesting when I wanted to implement some of the more complicated features of my website. I did not come up with the code for most interactive elements on my website myself, but <em>actually downloaded</em> other web pages and cut out the relevant code sections. I cite these websites in my code, which you can find by downloading, for example, this page. Another great knowledge resource was <a href=”https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp”>w3schools</a>, where I looked up HTML and CSS tags. I had no idea how to bring my website online, and so I reached out to a friend who had created a few websites before. After I had acquired a domain (you get a free domain at <a href=”https://www.namecheap.com/”>namecheap</a> for one year when you do the codecademy course I mentioned above), he helped me to host my website on <a href=”https://www.netlify.com/”>netlify </a> and connect it to GitHub. All services are free. Overall, I spent about <strong>40 to 60 hours</strong> on learning and coding.
