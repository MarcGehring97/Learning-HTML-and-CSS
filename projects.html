          <p id="project1"><strong>[Started on 4th of November 2020 and finished on 9th of November 2020]</strong><br>I started this project since I was looking for a realistic challenge to improve my coding skills. Moreover, this pandemic has really impaired my social life and I was looking for a distraction üòÅ. Now, I‚Äôm aware that HTML and CSS are not programming languages, but the activity still helped me in understanding the formal proceedings of writing code. I tried to take away as much as possible from this experience, and so I also used GitHub to organize my coding activity. For those of you who do not know, GitHub is an environment, in which you can write your code and also track changes over time. It‚Äôs also useful when you work on a project as a team since you can discuss changes and revert to earlier versions of your code if necessary. Above getting familiar with GitHub, I also learned how to use the terminal to navigate among different folders and files and commit and push changes in git. I started preparing by watching the first and second lecture of <a href=‚Äùhttps://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/‚Äù> this course</a> offered by Harvard University. While these lectures gave me a good theoretical basis for my project, I still needed some applied knowledge. In fact, I tried to start coding right after watching both lectures, but I quickly came to realize that I needed more exposure to HTML and CSS. Consequently, I took the codecademy courses <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website‚Äù> ‚ÄúHow to Make a Website with NameCheap‚Äù</a> and <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-responsive-design‚Äù> ‚ÄúLearn Responsive Design‚Äù</a>. (The following courses might also prove useful to you, should you be interested in starting a similar project for yourself: <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-bootstrap‚Äù> ‚ÄúLearn Bootstrap‚Äù</a>, <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-navigation-design
            ‚Äù> ‚ÄúLearn Navigation Design‚Äù</a>, and <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.codecademy.com/learn/build-interactive-websites
            ‚Äù> ‚ÄúBuild Interactive Websites‚Äù</a>.) codecademy offers a one-week trial, so make sure to use that. The courses progress slowly at times and you have to stay focused, but lessons are hands-on and definitely worth your time! Having taken those courses, I felt prepared to proceed to the next stage (I actually started to code while I worked on the courses). Before fully immersed myself in coding, though, I drafted my homepage in PowerPoint to have an implementation blueprint. I took a lot of ideas, such as the rolling letters on my homepage, from other websites, but the space design is entirely my work. When I finally started to code my website, I tried to stick to the Bootstrap structure, a framework that helps you to organize your website, but I did not manage to realize all my ideas within this framework. In the end, I added some @media section in my style sheet to make my website responsive to an acceptable degree. Beyond that, the coding in HTML and CSS is rather straight-forward. My project became interesting when I wanted to implement some of the more complicated features. I did not come up with the code for most interactive elements on my website myself, but <em>downloaded</em> other web pages and cut out the appropriate code sections. I cite these websites in my code, which you can find by downloading, for example, this page. Another great knowledge resource I used was <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.w3schools.com/default.asp‚Äù>w3schools</a>, where I looked up HTML and CSS tags. I had no idea how to bring my website online, and so I reached out to a friend who had created a few websites before. After I had purchased a domain (you get a free domain at <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.namecheap.com/‚Äù>NameCheap</a> for one year when you do the codecademy course I mentioned above), he instructed me to host my website on <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.netlify.com/‚Äù>netlify </a> and connect it to GitHub. All services are free. Overall, I spent about <strong>40 to 60 hours</strong> on learning and coding. Completing this project, I now have a better understanding of front-end development, which might be important in conjunction with my efforts regarding back-end engineering. Up next, I want to add a commenting function below my <a href="about.html">about</a> text and a <a href="visitorsbook.html">visitor‚Äôs book</a>. But this won‚Äôt be my priority, since I am focusing on understanding python and in particular algorithms in python better right now. If you have any questions or criticism towards my code and design feel free to reach out üòä.

                <ul>
                  <li>Programs are in Java; log(N) usually means log2(N)</li>
                  <li>Eager algorithm & binary search algorithm; if you cannot determine complexity by computation, empirically determine complexity by running a regression</li>
                  <li>Algorithm complexity (running time vs number of calculations)</li>
                  <li>Running time and memory requirements</li>
                  <li>Stacks: a fundamental data structure, that represents ordered data points</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Two ways to access: LIFO or FIFO</li>
                    <li>Stack implementation: linked-list or array; represents LIFO approach (queues represent FIFO method)</li>
                    <li>Disadvantage of array in Java: you have to define the capacity beforehand (chance of stack overflow)</li>
                    <ul><li>Dynamic sizing: double array size when the array is full; halve size when array is 1/4-full</li></ul>
                    <li>Generic stack (handle multiple types of data with one implementation; only possible with the linked-list implementation, ignoring casting)</li>
                    <li>Java collections library: java.util.stack (cannot predict performance; important to understand performance characteristics)</li>
                    <li>Dijkstra‚Äôs two-stack algorithm (low-level algorithm; operand (value) stack and operator stack; ignore left parenthesis, apply last operation between last two operands when facing right parenthesis)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Sorting algorithms</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Java comparable interface => no dependence on date type; define different modes of sorting</li>
                    <li>Different sort methods: compare and swap</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Selection sort: ~N¬≤/2 compares and ~N swaps (exchanges); has to go through all data points even when list is partially sorted</li>
                      <li>Insertion sort: ~N¬≤/4 compares and ~N¬≤/4 swaps; best case, N-1 compares and 0 swaps (ascending order); worst case, ~N¬≤/2 compares  and ~n¬≤/2 swaps => partially sorted helps (runs in linear time)</li>
                      <li>Shell sort: Improvement to insertion sort; partial sorts that sum to the total; fewer swaps; partial sorted doesn‚Äôt make much of a difference; unknown complexity</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Mergesort; reduced running time by many orders of magnitude; uses at most Nlog(N) compares and 6Nlog(N) swaps (log(N) because of division); an example of a divide-and-conquor algorithm; recursion needed</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Bottom-up merge sort (no recursion needed, but uses extra space)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Optimal algorithm: Upper bound of operation counts equals lower bound; mergesort is an optimal algorithm with respect to number of compares, but not with respect to space usage</li>
                    <li>Sort stability (multidimensional arrays): a stable sort preserves the relative order of items with equal keys; insertion sort and mergesort are stable because there are no ‚Äúlong-distance‚Äù swaps</li>
                    <li>Quicksort: shuffle and then partition; recursion; advantage over mergesort: doesn‚Äôt take any extra space; best case ~Nlog(N), worst case N¬≤/2 (also depends on initial shuffle);  average number of comparisons = 1.39Nlog(N) => 39% more compares than merge sort, but faster because of less data movement; the random shuffle at the beginning guarantees against the worst case; not stable; leave small partitions unsorted to be picked up with insertion sort at the end (see below)</li>
                    <li>Combine different sorting algorithms to capitalize in their strengths (insertion sort for a partially sorted array that has been sorted by merge sort, for example)</li>
                    <li>Some algorithms have too much overhead; use insertion sort for arrays of length <= between 10 and 20 (improves other sorting algorithms)</li>
                    <li>With duplicate keys: algorithm goes quadratic unless partitioning stops on equal keys => stop scans on items equal to the partitioning item or 3-way partitioning (can turn quicksort linear</li>
                    <li>Shuffling: Orders data randomly; </li>
                    <li>Convex hull:  is the smallest perimeter fence enclosing all points</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Graham scan algorithm: sort by polar angle and check whether angle between points is greater than 180¬∞ (my naive idea: compute centre of area and determine radial distances)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Many other algorithms, for example, convex hull computations, are based on sorting</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Also search algorithms, for example search for kth smallest item, min, max, and median; ‚ÄúQuick select‚Äù takes linear time on average (recursion unneeded), n¬≤ worst case</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Further concept: entropy-optimal (not treated in course)</li>
                    <li>There are countless sorting algorithms to choose from (trade-offs in terms of performance) => there is no algorithms that is perfect for any application</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Priority queue: useful in filtering; constant-size stack, updating the stack and deleting existing items under certain conditions (filters); generic algorithms take too long (linear time)</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Complete tree: perfectly balanced, except for bottom level</li>
                    <li>Heap-ordered binary tree (data structure): swim and sink functions to adjust the order; at most 2log(N) compares for deleting</li>
                    <li>Heapsort: first construct heap and then iteratively retrieve items at the top => list of all items at the top; construction takes at most 2N compares and exchange, sort uses at most 2Nlog(N) compares and exchanges (guaranteed!); disadvantages: memory & not stable</li>
                    <li>Event-driven simulations: write efficient collision code; when a time interval is small you need many computation, when a time interval is large you might miss collisions => solution: focus on times when collisions by predicting the collisions (in general, the event) occurs; record all possible collisions in a priority queue; make new prediction after each event</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Symbol table (data structure): similar to python dictionary?</li>
                  <li>Binary search tree (BST): Search and insert algorithm for symbol tables; a binary tree in symmetric order; constant time over different operations (e.g. search, insert, max, etc.), namely h (height of tree, proportional to log(N) if keys inserted in random order); efficient alternative to sequential search and binary search; in case of deletion leave the key in the tree (‚Äútombstone‚Äù), value to null; deletion of minimum value possible; Hibbard deletion deletes a node entirely (runs in sqrt(N) time)</li>
                  <li>2-3 tree: recursive; Ofer each transformation maintains perfect balance and symmetric order; every path has the same length; worst case, log(N); best case, 0.631log(N); guaranteed logarithmic time</li>
                  <li>Red-black BST: Represents 2-3 trees as a BST; maintains symmetric order and perfect black balance; 1-1 correspondence with 2-3 trees; the longest path can be no more than twice as long as the shortest path => balance; height of tree is <= 2log(N) in worst case; are widely used as system symbol tables</li>
                  <li>B-tree: Generalize 2-3 trees</li>
                  <li>Best practice in Java: use immutable types</li>
                  <li>1d range search: find the values in an interval / find the number of values in an interval; BST is a solution</li>
                  <li>Sweep-line algorithm: find intersections between vertical and horizontal line segments; uses 1d range search</li>
                  <li>2d orthogonal range search: find the values in an rectangular range (searching in geometric data); search by two variables; clustering problem => space-partitioning trees; search typically takes R+log(N), worst case R*sqrt(N) (R: number of intersections); can also be used to find closest point in plane; typical case then log(N) and worst case N</li>
                  <li>Kd trees use the same ideas</li>
                  <li>Kd Interval search: search for intervals</li>
                  <li>Orthogonal rectangle intersection search: sweep-line algorithm reduces to 1s interval search</li>
                  <li>Hashing: different data structure; issues of dealing with collisions => different solutions</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Separate chaining (looking inside bucket); if size of array smaller than the number of keys</li>
                    <li>If number of keys greater than size of array => linear probing; better to have fewer keys in comparison to size of array, because at the end the hashing takes many computation (clustering) => array resizing to make sure that the array is always half-full => constant-time performance</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Computational cost increases with the length of the keys => simplifications</li>
                  <li>There are mcoany improved versions</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Algorithms can be simple, but simple algorithms often take too long => creativity to come up with simpler solutions</li>
                  <li>Fibonacci algorithms</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>emma: Fn >= 2^(n/2) for n >= 6 (proof by induction)</li>
                    <li>Running time in terms of required computations</li>
                    <li>Recursive algorithms needs at least as many computations as the to be computed Fibonacci number => red flag</li>
                    <li>The reason are repeated computations (Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 = Fn-2 + Fn-3 + Fn-2 = ‚Ä¶)</li>
                    <li>Solution: store results; compute current number as sum of the two previously saved numbers</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Greatest Common Divisor algorithms</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A variable ‚Äúd‚Äù divides both numerator ‚Äúa‚Äù and denominator ‚Äúb‚Äù; d has to be as large as possible</li>
                    <li>Important for number theory and cryptography (primes numbers)</li>
                    <li>Naive algorithm runs through for-loop a + b times</li>
                    <li>Key lemma: a‚Äô is the remainder when a is divided by b, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(a‚Äô, b) = gcd(b, a‚Äô)</li>
                    <li>Solution: recursive call for remainder of division, but in reverse order: gcd(b, a‚Äô)</li>
                    <li>Takes log(ab) steps</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Defining runtime</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Lines of code are not comparable in runtime</li>
                    <li>Run time depends on many factors (system architecture, program structure)</li>
                    <li>Assumption: all of these factors can multiply runtimes by (large) constants => find a measure that ignores the constants</li>
                    <li>Solution: Asymptotic notation => how does runtime scale with input size</li>
                    <li>log(n) < sqrt(n) < n < nlog(n) < n¬≤ < n^n</li>
                    <li>Big-O notation is simpler and cleaner (no base for logarithm); can ignore complicated details; is an upper bound</li>
                    <li>f(n) = O(g(n)): f(n) grows no faster than g(n)</li>
                    <li>Drawbacks of Big-O include that it loses important information about constant multiples and that it‚Äôs only  asymptotic (for very large inputs)</li>
                    <li>The last fib algorithm took O(n¬≤)</li>
                    <li>Further notations for lower bounds, etc.</li>
                    <li>Logarithmic rules I was unfamiliar with: a^(logb(c)) = c^(logb(a)) and loga(n) * logb(a) = logb(n)</li>
                    <li>Levels of algorithms design: naive algorithm => algorithm by way of standard tools => optimised algorithm => magic algorithm</li>
                    <li>Find the n last digits of a number: number % 10^n</li>
                    <li>Pisano Period</li>

                    <li>Reduction into subproblems</li>
                    <li>Safe move if there is an optimal solution consistent with this first move</li>
                    <li>Make a greedy choice => check that it‚Äôs a safe move => reduce to subproblem</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Divide and conquer algorithms</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Divide the big problems in smaller subproblems of the same type that do not overlap</li>
                    <li>Solution: recursion using the same strategy</li>
                    <li>Linear search runs in linear time</li>
                    <li>Binary search works for sorted arrays and runs in log(n)</li>
                    <li>Different algorithms to multiply polynomials </li>
                    <li>The Master Theorem allows to figure out easily the running time</li>
                    <li>Selection sort: find minimum in list and put in front; takes the same time for all input data; quadratic running time</li>
                    <li>Merge sort: a divide and conquer algorithm; comparison based; runs in  nlog(n) time</li>
                    <li>Non-comparison based sorting algorithms: Count sort counts occurrence of all different numbers and the list them consecutively; requires 3 loops</li>
                    <li>Quick sort: runs in different times for more or less sorted data; select the pivot element randomly guarantees an average running time nlog(n); bad for data sets that contain few unique elements => 3-way partition; deterministic version involves using the median as the pivot</li>
                    <li>Combine different sorting algorithms to leverage different performance strengths</li>
                  </ul>
