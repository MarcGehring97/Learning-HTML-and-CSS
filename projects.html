          <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Website Development</h1>
          <p id="project1"><strong>[Started on 4th of November 2020 and finished on 9th of November 2020]</strong><br>I started this project since I was looking for a realistic challenge to improve my coding skills. Moreover, this pandemic has really impaired my social life and I was looking for a distraction üòÅ. Now, I‚Äôm aware that HTML and CSS are not programming languages, but the activity still helped me in understanding the formal proceedings of writing code. I tried to take away as much as possible from this experience, and so I also used GitHub to organize my coding activity. For those of you who do not know, GitHub is an environment, in which you can write your code and also track changes over time. It‚Äôs also useful when you work on a project as a team since you can discuss changes and revert to earlier versions of your code if necessary. Above getting familiar with GitHub, I also learned how to use the terminal to navigate among different folders and files and commit and push changes in git. I started preparing by watching the first and second lecture of <a href=‚Äùhttps://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/‚Äù> this course</a> offered by Harvard University. While these lectures gave me a good theoretical basis for my project, I still needed some applied knowledge. In fact, I tried to start coding right after watching both lectures, but I quickly came to realize that I needed more exposure to HTML and CSS. Consequently, I took the codecademy courses <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website‚Äù> ‚ÄúHow to Make a Website with NameCheap‚Äù</a> and <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-responsive-design‚Äù> ‚ÄúLearn Responsive Design‚Äù</a>. (The following courses might also prove useful to you, should you be interested in starting a similar project for yourself: <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-bootstrap‚Äù> ‚ÄúLearn Bootstrap‚Äù</a>, <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-navigation-design
            ‚Äù> ‚ÄúLearn Navigation Design‚Äù</a>, and <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.codecademy.com/learn/build-interactive-websites
            ‚Äù> ‚ÄúBuild Interactive Websites‚Äù</a>.) codecademy offers a one-week trial, so make sure to use that. The courses progress slowly at times and you have to stay focused, but lessons are hands-on and definitely worth your time! Having taken those courses, I felt prepared to proceed to the next stage (I actually started to code while I worked on the courses). Before fully immersed myself in coding, though, I drafted my homepage in PowerPoint to have an implementation blueprint. I took a lot of ideas, such as the rolling letters on my homepage, from other websites, but the space design is entirely my work. When I finally started to code my website, I tried to stick to the Bootstrap structure, a framework that helps you to organize your website, but I did not manage to realize all my ideas within this framework. In the end, I added some @media section in my style sheet to make my website responsive to an acceptable degree. Beyond that, the coding in HTML and CSS is rather straight-forward. My project became interesting when I wanted to implement some of the more complicated features. I did not come up with the code for most interactive elements on my website myself, but <em>downloaded</em> other web pages and cut out the appropriate code sections. I cite these websites in my code, which you can find by downloading, for example, this page. Another great knowledge resource I used was <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.w3schools.com/default.asp‚Äù>w3schools</a>, where I looked up HTML and CSS tags. I had no idea how to bring my website online, and so I reached out to a friend who had created a few websites before. After I had purchased a domain (you get a free domain at <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.namecheap.com/‚Äù>NameCheap</a> for one year when you do the codecademy course I mentioned above), he instructed me to host my website on <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.netlify.com/‚Äù>netlify </a> and connect it to GitHub. All services are free. Overall, I spent about <strong>40 to 60 hours</strong> on learning and coding. Completing this project, I now have a better understanding of front-end development, which might be important in conjunction with my efforts regarding back-end engineering. Up next, I want to add a commenting function below my <a href="about.html">about</a> text and a <a href="visitorsbook.html">visitor‚Äôs book</a>. But this won‚Äôt be my priority, since I am focusing on understanding python and in particular algorithms in python better right now. If you have any questions or criticism towards my code and design feel free to reach out üòä.

          <p id="project2"><strong>[Started on 18th of November 2020]</strong><br>I want to make the best of the current situation and use my extra time to develop a better understanding of topics in computer and data science. For this purpose, I have decided to audit many online courses on edx and Coursera. Moreover, I will take some codecademy courses to practice my coding skills. I have created the following curriculum for myself. Check out my progress! Feel free to apply criticism or suggest extra courses or souces.<br><br><br><strong>Playbook CS/DS</strong><br><br>
