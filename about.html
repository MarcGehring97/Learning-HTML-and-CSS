            <p><strong>Searching For My Paradigm</strong> [work in progress]<br>

              Our societies have moved beyond their full dependency on physical labor. This gives us seemingly unlimited opportunities to use our minds to shape our world according to our liking. 
              As a consequence of this freedom of decision, there is disagreement about what we should prioritize and with what resources and deservedly so. Therefore, I have decided to write this text as I find it important that we all enunciate our opinions and stances on current grave topics in a well-grounded and reasoned manner. I, for example, advocate advance in science and technology by simultaneously tackling fundamental challenges in our societies. At the same time, I am strongly concerned about such shortsighted behavior as exhibited by numerous governments globally. I’m talking about ignoring climate change and social inequality issues. Public indifference in these matters is detrimental. I, too, have been indifferent for a long time. I even realized and proudly stated that I was indifferent; how preposterous is that? Lately, however, a few experiences [specify] have assisted me in gaining a broader conscience and understanding of issues that we all are facing, and I have adapted my philosophy accordingly. Thankfully, I am not immediately affected by these issues, but I see the dangers of staying indifferent and the merits of solidarity, and hence I want to speak out. In this text, therefore, I share some of the discussions I am having with myself right now, describe current issues that need to be tackled, and suggest possible solutions or mitigations.

                I cherish science and I am deeply determined to dedicate myself to technological progress by applying it, but as fascinating as concepts such as space exploration or artificial intelligence are, we first need to “fix” problems within our society. The last part raised two questions: First, is the word “fix” really appropriate here? Can we ever fix our societies and is there even a need for a fix? Second, in what order should we tackle these issues? Can we permit ourselves to reach for the stars and explore the solar system when there are still wars raging in developing countries? Are <em>our</em> societies even <em>good</em> enough yet? In my view, we should focus on our societies from an ethical standpoint, but realistically, we can only spend so much money on, for example, the domestic education system, social programs, and foreign aids. There will still be spare funds for such research projects as fusion reactors, whose outcomes are uncertain, and which can be perceived as luxurious investments without any immediate benefit for us. 
                Beyond such ethical dilemmas, some obvious flaws and fallacies make our life harder today. We all have to take a firm stand against any kind of racism, sexism, and any other form of prejudicial or discriminating attitude against any other human being. To my mind, the prevalence of these beliefs today is unexplainable from a perspective of reason and compassion; They are a consequence of risk-aversion and partially a lack of education, without meaning to sound contemptuous. People tend to prefer the familiar to the new and base their opinions on false assumptions that arise from the fear of the unknown. Moreover, a very human natural tendency is to confuse correlation with causality and over-generalize as a matter of pattern-building. Simplifying by making assumptions is justified in many situations, but when it comes to judging by appearance, I strongly disapprove of it. From the perspective of productivity, as well, are racism and sexism foolish. The increase in output in some Middle Eastern countries, for example, Saudi Arabia, since they have legalized female participation in the workforce serves as evidence for my point. Getting rid of racism and sexism would enable our societies to focus on problems I deem much more important. Built on a solid foundation of sustainable and social societies, then, we would be able to solve any challenge that comes our way. As one race, we have accomplished so much thus far but there is yet much to be explored and improved. To reach this goal, however, we still have to walk a few extra miles and <em>we all</em> need to contribute. I don’t necessarily want to make our lives more comfortable but save us time to focus on more important issues.
                In making this call I do not demand us to start acting entirely altruistically; I am simply of the conviction that exerting effort for the sake of supporting society is surprisingly compatible with a rational, selfish approach. This idea may displease you, but please bear with me. One of the many benefits of being organized as a society is that of cooperation surplus. When we stop fighting among ourselves for our short-term individual gains, we can concentrate on improving our living conditions together. This reasoning is well established in social science, particularly in economics, which I studied. Now, to this end, I say that we all need to give our best effort in any area of life. Be it studying, understanding other human beings, being well informed and checking facts, or caring about our environment, we should always at least try wholeheartedly. The attempt is <em>good</em> in and on itself. So, from this perspective, there is a straightforward rationale that combines self-interest with societal benefit.
                A government plays the following role in this paradigm: Governments, to my mind, ought to organize public goods and services that are to the benefit of multiple citizens at once, above their purpose of providing stability and protecting rights. Importantly, I say that the government should ideally be the only source of social services since social services as per definition are services for the public. By saying “only”, I mean to exclude companies. The chief purpose of any company should be to improve itself by becoming more efficient and providing goods and services that people <em>actually</em> need. (Related to this, I disapprove of developments in different types of media, but this is a different topic.) To this effect, I take a critical look at social and environmental company initiatives that serve the purpose of gaining a competitive advantage (“greenwashing”). Such aims should be ignited by intrinsic motivation and derive from the awareness that social services are <em>good</em>. Whereas companies today <em>are actually</em> acting strongly selfishly and thereby fulfilling their purpose in creating value, our governments fail in providing for social stability and the adequate distribution of the generated wealth. In this regard, one of the improvements I would suggest is higher taxes on passive income. My thought goes as follows: In principle, everyone should earn income according to his/her labor. Companies need an ownership structure, especially in their early stage as an incentive for innovation and risk-taking. But as time goes by, there are more and more people who are involved in the success of a company. Correspondingly, I would find it reasonable if these employees receive a stake in the company proportional to their effort and tenure in a company. Alternatively, the company could pay out its earnings in the form of higher salaries. I know that some German companies are actually structured similarly (for example Bosch) but there are too few of them and the degree to which these companies execute such a policy could also be greater. What I’m saying is that employees should participate in their employers’ success; Thinking on a broader level, employees also receive remunerations for the prosperity of the industry in which they’re working and the economy overall. Employees should also receive a stake on those levels. But the less direct the economic impact of his/her labor is, the less should an individual be allowed to receive passive income, to preserve the link between labor and remuneration. This relation is inverted in the case of the government. The government should receive passive income that is earned by societal cooperation on a country level. It’s the government existence’s merit that such profits are even possible in the first place, and accordingly, they pertain to the government, to be invested in social goods that benefit everyone (such as infrastructure or public education and research) to provide for equity in opportunity (to what degree this is really possible is another discussion I would gladly engage in). Of course, cooperation should not be taxed per se, just on a macro level. On another note, I think that inheritance is another area that inevitably leads to social disparity. Including personal fondness for particular objects (for example, the parental home), there are no strong reasons why one individual should be endowed with more wealth than another by birthright. We need to rethink this concept.
                
                I am aware that a part of my philosophy is idealistic, and in consideration of our imperfect world (different opinions and needs as well as changing circumstances over time) unrealistic or beyond that even <em>bad</em> in your eyes. By no means do I want to be narrow-minded or too drawn to one paradigm. I ultimately aim to describe my ideal world and improve my understanding of existing conditions to make my ideas and objectives more realistic, by also considering competing ideas. I think of it as a maximation problem given constraints.
                While I claim to approach these issues with a good understanding of economics and other areas of social and natural science, I still may be lacking in some of these areas and am making clearly wrong assumptions, so feel free to reach out and start a discussion. 
                Homogeneity in thought can be fallacious. It is not given that my philosophy is <em>good</em> or <em>the best</em>. Akin to the evolutionary thought, competition in thought can provide for better outcomes, and therefore I am always willing to learn, unlearn, relearn, change, and grow. Even this very meta-idea may be faulty and therefore I will always view ideas (mine and other people’s) with a certain level of fundamental skepticism.
